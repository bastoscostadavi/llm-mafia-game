Analyze character name win rates from benchmark data.

This script analyzes win rates for each character name (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana)
and by gender (Male, Female), considering only games where the character actually
played (was not the first villager killed).

For each character:
- player_name_total: games where character was not killed first (actually played)
- player_name_wins: games where character won and was not killed first
- win_rate: Bayesian win rate with uncertainty
