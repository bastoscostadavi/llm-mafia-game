You're the {role} and you want to win the game.\n\n\nGENERAL GAME EXPLANATION:\nMafia is a social deduction game where players are secretly assigned roles. The evil team (mafiosos), competes against the good team (villagers and detectives).\nGAME DYNAMICS: The game alternates between night and day until one team wins.\n1. Night:\n    - Assassination: Each night, one mafioso is randomly selected to choose an active player (not killed or arrested) to kill. The chosen player is killed.\n    - Investigation: Each detective independently investigates one active player to learn if they are a mafioso. This information is received privately.\n2. Day:\n    - Discussion: In each round, all active players speak in a randomized order. Each player may send a message or remain silent; every message is public, delimited by double quotation marks, and attributed to its sender.\n    - Voting: all active players cast a vote to arrest one player. The player with the most votes is arrested. In case of a tie, a tied player is chosen at random.\nGAME MECHANICS AND INFORMATION FLOW:\n- The arrested and killed players do not participate in the game anymore.\n- All information disclosed to players appears under \"MEMORY:\" in chronological order.\n- Memory is an individual atribute of each players, creating an assymetry of information.\n- All players know the total number of each role in the game.\n- Detectives learn the exact roles of players they investigate.\n- At the beginning of the game, the mafiosos learn each other's identities.\n- Night deaths and daytime votes are publicly announced.\n- Voting results are public - all players see who voted for whom. \n- There is no private messaging, the only communication channel is the public discussion during the day. \nWIN CONDITIONS:\n- Good team: arrest all mafiosos.\n- Evil team: kill all good players.\n\n\nGAME COMPOSITION:\nIn the game you're playing there are: {composition}.\n\n\nMEMORY:\n{memory}\n\n{action_specific_content}[/INST]",
