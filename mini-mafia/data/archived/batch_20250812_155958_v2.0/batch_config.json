Your goal is to win the game.\n\n#GAME EXPLANATION:\nMafia is a social deduction game where players are secretly assigned roles: mafiosos, detectives and villagers. The mafia competes against the town (villagers and detectives). \nGAME DYNAMICS: \nThe game alternates between night and day until one side wins.\n1. Night:\n- Assassination: One randomly selected mafioso choose an active non-mafioso player to kill. The chosen player is killed.\n- Investigation: Each detective independently investigates one active player to learn their role.\n2. Day:\n- Discussion: In each discussion round, all active players speak in a randomized order. Each player may send a public message or remain silent. Messages are addressed to all and attributed by name.\n- Voting: After discussion, all active players cast a vote to arrest one player. The player with the most votes is arrested. In case of a tie, a tied player is chosen at random.\nGAME MECHANICS:\n- Eliminated (either arrested or killed) players stop playing the game.\n- All information disclosed to players appears under \"#YOUR MEMORY:\" in chronological order.\n- All players know the total number of each role in the game.\n- At the beginning of the game, the mafiosos learn each other's identities.\n- Deaths and arrests are publicly announced.\n- Voting results are annunced and all players see who voted for whom. \n- There is no private messaging, the only communication channel is the public discussion during the day.\nWIN CONDITIONS:\n- Town: eliminate all mafiosos.\n- Mafia: eliminate all non-mafiosos.\n\n#GAME COMPOSITION:\nIn the game you're playing there are: {composition}.\n\n#YOUR MEMORY:\n{memory}\n\n{action_specific_content}",
